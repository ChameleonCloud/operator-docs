# Ticketmaster Guide

The `ticketmaster` is our name for the weekly user-support role. It currently rotates between staff at UChicago and TACC.

## Responsibilities

The ticketmaster is responsible for triaging user-tickets, and for addressing a subset of them.

Proposal: Issues that require reconfiguring an openstack site, editing a database directly, or fixing a hardware failure should be forwarded to the relevant site operator via TODO

## Common user requests

Here's a list of common user requests, TODO link to docs for each


- Remove me from mailing lists
- delete my account
- change a bios setting
- set a node to exclusive project access
- update quota for a specfic site

## Common user issues

Separate from requests, these require some diagnosis

- help, I can't log in
- failed to allocate IP address
